        <h3>Mounts For GoPro & Cases</h3>
        <p>There are two types of mechanical shutters: the leaf-type shutter and the focal-plane shutter. The leaf-type uses a circular iris diaphragm maintained under spring tension inside or just behind the lens that rapidly opens and closes when the shutter is released</p>
        <p>The duration for which the shutter is open is called the shutter speed or exposure time. Typical exposure times can range from one second to 1/1,000 of a second, though longer and shorter durations are not uncommon. In the early stages of photography, exposures were often several minutes long.</p>

        <h3>Batteries & SD Cards & Mount Clips</h3>        
        <p>The tables below indicate the approximate recording time (in minutes) you can expect when shooting in various modes using a new, fully-charged, official GoPro battery. Maximum battery capacity decreases with age and use, and many batteries are no longer available for purchase, which is why they are not listed here. The estimates are averages and are based on GoPro engineering testing under optimal conditions (50Â°F, Wi-Fi, GPS, Stabilization, Voice Control all turned off, and LCDs set to turn off after one minute). Actual performance may vary based on settings, environmental conditions, and other factors.  This page is updated periodically as we continue to test, and as a result, shooting times may change</p>
